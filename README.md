üõ†Ô∏èA curated list of awesome things related to browser polyfills
Polyfills help standardize the HTML, Javascript and CSS support across web browsers. 

## Contents
## Introduction
### Native Usage Score
The native usage score indicates how common this feature is supported natively. The score is based on caniuse.com and is quite strict by purpose. Please note, that this score has nothing to do with the polyfill itself. This doesn't indicate how good / bad the polyfill is, only how much it is needed. 
- ![#2aed11](https://placehold.it/12/2aed11/000000?text=+) `High Native Support` - Indicates that at least 90% of all browsers support this feature natively.
- ![#f0cb13](https://placehold.it/12/f0cb13/000000?text=+) `Moderate Native Support` - Indicates that at least 70% of all browsers support this feature natively.
- ![#fa3e00](https://placehold.it/12/fa3e00/000000?text=+) `Low Native Support` - Anything below.
- ![#fa3e00](https://placehold.it/12/fa3e00/000000?text=+) `Obsolete` - A feature that is obsoloted, and should not be used nor polyfilled.

### How Polyfills are picked
The main polyfill suggested is always the one that is the easiest to implement, the most stable and with the least depencencies. If there is another good / better option that requires a build tool or a framework, it might still be shown inside the polyfill description.
